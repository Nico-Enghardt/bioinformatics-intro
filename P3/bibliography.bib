Beautiful Evidence is about how seeing turns into showing, how empirical observations turn into explanations and evidence presentations. The book identifies excellent and effective methods for presenting information, suggests new designs, and provides tools for assessing the credibility of evidence presentations. Here we will see many close readings of serious evidence presentations - ranging through evolutionary trees and rocket science to economics, art history, and sculpture. Insistent application of the principles of analytical thinking helps both insiders and outsiders assess the credibility of evidence.

abstract = {Cancer hypoxia, a crucial characteristic of malignancy, ranging from practically non-hypoxic to severe, impacts gene expression, metabolism and mechanisms associated with tumor formation serves as a key obstacle in cancer therapy. It triggers a complex network of cell signaling pathways, such as the NF-κB, PI3K, mTOR/AKT,MAPK, HIF and their associated genes regulating the effects of the same. The onset and advancement of cancer are attributed to genetic and epigenetic modifications which are intrinsically related. Off late, it has been observed that in disease progression, the epigenetic modifications lead to gene mutations that in turn alter the epigenome, presenting a major hurdle in fabricating treatment strategies. However, theprogress in science and technology has led to the emergence of various surfacing omics and multi-view clustering algorithms, which offer unparalleled prospects for further subtyping cancers, enhancing the prognosis and treatment results of these subtypes, and comprehending crucial pathophysiological mechanisms across diverse molecular strata. Multi-omics has allowed scientists to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the various ways that cellular malfunction can lead to cancer. So, it becomes of utmost importance to firstly understand the epigenetic changes taking place in tumor hypoxia at gene level. This review sheds light on the role of HIF gene in hypoxic milieu and its relationship with mechanisms of cancer epigenetics. It further glances as to how omics approach can be used to study the oncogenic cellular changes and how bioinformatic tools aid in identification of complex gene networks involved in disease progression. Lastly, it glimpses through the benefits and shortcomings of the existing epi drug therapy and how it can be used in developing novel treatment options.}

abstract = {Currently, numerous papers are published reporting analysis of biological data at different omics levels by making statistical inferences. Of note, many studies, as those published in this Journal, report association of gene(s) at the genomic and transcriptomic levels by undertaking appropriate statistical tests. For instance, genotype, allele or haplotype frequencies at the genomic level or normalized expression levels at the transcriptomic level are compared between the case and control groups using the Chi-square/Fisher’s exact test or independent (i.e. two-sampled) t-test respectively, with this culminating into a single numeric, namely the P value (or the degree of the false positive rate), which is used to make or break the outcome of the association test. This approach has flaws but nevertheless remains a standard and convenient approach in association studies. However, what becomes a critical issue is that the same cut-off is used when ‘multiple’ tests are undertaken on the same case-control (or any pairwise) comparison. Here, in brevity, we present what the P value represents, and why and when it should be adjusted. We also show, with worked examples, how to adjust P values for multiple testing in the R environment for statistical computing (http://www.R-project.org).},

They resist mechanical stress because they adopt a strongly adhesive state in which they are said to be hyper-adhesive and which distinguishes them from other intercellular junctions; desmosomes are specialised for strong adhesion and their failure can result in diseases of the skin and heart. They are also dynamic structures whose adhesiveness can switch between high and low affinity adhesive states during processes such as embryonic development and wound healing, the switching being signalled by protein kinase C. Desmosomes may also act as signalling centres, regulating the availability of signalling molecules and thereby participating in fundamental processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation and morphogenesis. Here we consider the structure, composition and function of desmosomes, and their role in embryonic development and disease.}

La filagrina es una proteína estructural fundamental para el desarrollo y mantenimiento de la barrera cutánea. En los últimos años se ha llevado a cabo una extensa investigación sobre su función y su implicación en distintos trastornos cutáneos y extracutáneos. Se ha comprobado que las mutaciones en el gen que la codifica, el gen FLG, son la causa de la ictiosis vulgar y confieren un mayor riesgo de desarrollar dermatitis atópica y otras enfermedades atópicas, además de agravar algunas enfermedades. El presente artículo revisa la información existente en cuanto a su papel en la barrera cutánea, así como respecto a las mutaciones en el gen FLG y las consecuencias que conlleva el déficit de filagrina.}

Here, we report that the lncRNA LINC00941 is a crucial regulator of human epidermal homeostasis. LINC00941 is enriched in progenitor keratinocytes and acts as a repressor of keratinocyte differentiation. Furthermore, LINC00941 represses SPRR5, a previously uncharacterized molecule, which functions as an essential positive regulator of keratinocyte differentiation. Interestingly, 54.8% of genes repressed in SPRR5-deficient epidermal tissue are induced in LINC00941-depleted organotypic epidermis, suggesting a common mode of action for both molecules.},

   abstract = {WFDC proteins such as peptidase inhibitor 3 and SLPI inhibit proteases in the epidermis and other tissues. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that further WFDC protein family members might contribute to epidermal homeostasis. We found that in addition to peptidase inhibitor 3 and SLPI, WFDC5 and WFDC12 were expressed in human epidermis. In contrast to WFDC5, the expression of WFDC12 was induced during the late differentiation of keratinocytes and was restricted to the outermost layer of live cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated that WFDC12-positive keratinocytes were characterized by the upregulation of LCE mRNA expression and downregulated the expression of keratins and claudins. Immunogold-electron microscopy revealed the colocalization of WFDC12 with corneodesmosomes in the lower stratum corneum. WFDC12 was elevated in the affected skin of patients with psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and Darier disease. By contrast, WFDC12 expression was strongly upregulated not only in the affected but even more so in clinically normal-appearing skin of patients with Netherton syndrome. Finally, functional analysis showed distinct inhibitory activity of WFDC12 on neutrophil elastase and epidermal kallikrein‒related peptidase. Altogether, our study identified WFDC12 as a marker of the last stage of epidermal keratinocyte differentiation and suggests that WFDC12 contributes to the control of protease activity in the stratum corneum.},

As knowledge of cancer mechanisms has progressed, other facets of the disease have emerged as potential refinements. Herein, the prospect is raised that phenotypic plasticity and disrupted differentiation is a discrete hallmark capability, and that nonmutational epigenetic reprogramming and polymorphic microbiomes both constitute distinctive enabling characteristics that facilitate the acquisition of hallmark capabilities. Additionally, senescent cells, of varying origins, may be added to the roster of functionally important cell types in the tumor microenvironment.Cancer is daunting in the breadth and scope of its diversity, spanning genetics, cell and tissue biology, pathology, and response to therapy. Ever more powerful experimental and computational tools and technologies are providing an avalanche of “big data” about the myriad manifestations of the diseases that cancer encompasses. The integrative concept embodied in the hallmarks of cancer is helping to distill this complexity into an increasingly logical science, and the provisional new dimensions presented in this perspective may add value to that endeavor, to more fully understand mechanisms of cancer development and malignant progression, and apply that knowledge to cancer medicine.},

All three complexes were found to be similar in distribution with the apoprotein through PCA analysis indicating conformational stability throughout the MD simulation.
