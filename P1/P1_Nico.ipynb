    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We are about to start a journey into real Bioinformatics. This series of **four hands-on training activities** will show you the basic workflows in bioinformatics: from the **data management and processing** with Linux, **visualization**, and posterior **functional analyses**. The practicals are divided into two big parts: **Part I: Basics on Bioinformatics workflows: Transforming data into insight** and **Part II: Solving real cases in genomics**.\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "These practicals pretend also to gain other skills, very valuable in research but rarely experienced during the Degree, such as **collaborating** and **doing reproducible research**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Part I: Basics on Bioinformatics workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part, **Basics on Bioinformatics workflows: Transforming data into insight**, consist on two practicals:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first practical (P1), **Using Linux in Bioinformatics**, you will learn the basic commands of Linux. Getting familiar with this commands is key in bioinformatics, as many pipelines rely on the combination of different tools through a terminal. In addition, biological data are stored in large text files that can be easily processed using Linux. In the second practical (P2), **Data exploration and visualization**, we will transform biological data into knowledge graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P1 Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get familiar with the Unix directories\n",
    "* Learn basic text-processing Linux commands and piping\n",
    "* Use the Linux command-line to perform tasks on the data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P2 Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn the grammar of graphics of `ggplot2`\n",
    "* Create the most common bioinformatics graphs (scatterplots, lineplots, barplots, ...)\n",
    "* Understand the important elements of a ready-to-publish figure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Practicals organization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.1 Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In these practicals, we are going to use **Jupyter Notebook** dashboard. A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive work environment that allows you to develop code in Python (and not only Python) dynamically, integrating blocks of code, text, graphics and images in the same document. It emerged in 2014 to offer the scientific community a very powerful set of tools to work with data, visualize it and be able to share the results with the community.\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This **new work philosophy** contrasts a lot with the idea that we usually have what programming and writing code is. This way of programming, called **literary programming**, emphasizes the purpose of writing comfortable text to read and understand, separated by blocks of code, combining text, equations and figures, and allowing sharing your research and results very easily.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, to **write our scientific reports**, we recommend using an online $\\LaTeX$ editor that's easy to use: [**Overleaf**](https://www.overleaf.com). We have created a ready-to-use template available [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vchzpswtycyg) so you can write your results.\n",
