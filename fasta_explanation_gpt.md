The first line starts with >, indicating a header in FASTA format, followed by several fields:

- *ENSMUSP00000142546.1*: The Ensembl protein ID, with .1 indicating the version of this protein sequence.
- *pep*
    : Indicates that this is a known peptide sequence (as opposed to a predicted sequence).

- *chromosome:GRCm38:14:54113468:54113476:1:* Specifies the genomic location of this gene on chromosome 14 based on the GRCm38 genome assembly. The coordinates are 54113468 to 54113476, and 1 indicates the strand orientation (1 for positive, -1 for negative).
- *gene*
    .2: The Ensembl gene ID, again with a version number.
- *transcript*
    .1: The Ensembl transcript ID associated with this protein.
- *gene_biotype*
    : Indicates the gene biotype, classifying it as a T-cell receptor delta (TRD) diversity (D) gene.
- *transcript_biotype*
    : Indicates that this transcript is also classified as a T-cell receptor delta diversity gene.
- *gene_symbol*
    : The gene symbol, Trdd1, which is an abbreviation for "T cell receptor delta diversity 1".
- *description*: Provides a functional description, "T cell receptor delta diversity 1," which is important in the immune response. It also includes a source reference: [Source:MGI Symbol;Acc:MGI:4439547], pointing to the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database with accession number MGI:4439547.
