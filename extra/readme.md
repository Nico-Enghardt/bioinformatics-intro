# Additional Work

To better understand python we have been playing around with it, mostly working on exercises and data provided by the rosalind project.
Since you suggested that we could upload additional work, please find what we did so far here.

We also upload Nico's original report and presentation of the heliobacter auto-diagnosis project.
Both go in more detail than was suited for the presentation in class, since they adressed an audience of computer science students.
